AWK-IDE for Vim/gVim is written to considerably speed up typesetting a document
in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting complete statements, idioms,
code snippets, templates, and comments.  Compiling and viewing a document,
format conversion and running make can be done with a few keystrokes.

- insert complete but empty statements
- insert various types of comments
- insert often used code snippets
- change existing templates, add new templates
- read, write, maintain your own code snippets in a separate directory
- show compilation erros in a quickfix window; navigate with hotkeys
